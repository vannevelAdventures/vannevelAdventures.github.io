Are we your average American family with 2.5 kids, a dog, and a white picket fence? Well...kinda (without the dog and half a kid). We are Tom and Miranda VanNevel. We have two girls Alexandra (9) and Olivia (5). We both work full time and do the typical parent, chauffeur, spouse tightrope walk of life. In the middle of all that we like to take as many camping trips a year as time and money allow. We started camping as an inexpensive way to travel. As we had kids our needs and what we considered camping changed. Those changes mean we have learned and continue to learn a lot about camping and traveling in general. We thought about writing a "how to" book about our trips but books literally have a shelf life. 

This blog is about where we have been, our mistakes you can learn from, and what we hope for from our future.
